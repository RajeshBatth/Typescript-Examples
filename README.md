# Why Typescript?
- It's complex and confusing
- It's slower to compile
- Adds more dev time
- Good code can be written in JS also and Bad code can be written in TS too. 

### The Cost of Subpar Code

We invest ten times more effort in reading code than in writing it. Neglecting the improvement of readability and maintainability can significantly exacerbate this situation, leading to:

- Increased time dedicated to understanding the code
- Lengthier debugging processes
- Prolonged schedules for implementing new features

### Identifying Poor Code Quality

* Obfuscates readability and comprehension
* Demonstrates unpredictable failures and inconsistent design
* Poses difficulties in debugging
* Exhibits numerous other undesirable traits

### Remedying Poor Code Quality

* Embracing Design By Contract Principles
  * Validate input parameters and furnish meaningful error codes and messages upon failure
  * Ensure a consistent return type in accordance with the specified design
* Enforcing Preventative Measures Through Static Analysis
  * Acknowledge that static types function as a form of testing
  * Uphold architectural integrity through the utilization of a type system or linting mechanisms
